        <div class="content">

          <p> The Web is a collection of HTML <em>(hyper text markup language) </em> documents. It was started in the early 1990s, and now has over 30 billion pages! Anything can exist on the web, including Text, Music, PDFs, Videos and HTML. </p>

          <p> The web can be broken down in to 3 major pieces - A computer with a <b> browser </b><em> (such as Safari, Internet Explorer, or Chrome)</em>, <b>servers</b>, remotely located computers that host the files that make up the web, and the<b> Internet</b>, the go between for the browser and servers. </p>

          <p> The browser makes requests to servers using HTTP protocols via the Internet, the browser then reads HTML, interpreting and displaying the page. </p>

        <div class="content">
            <p> Coding is writing in a language that computers can understand. Computers are considered "dumb" because they simply <em> follow directions</em>. So it is very important to give them clear directions with proper formatting <em> (syntax)</em> or the computer will return errors.</p>

          <br>Coding is made up of:
          <!-- List -->
          <ol>
            <li>
              <div class="list_title">Tags
                   <div class="list_info"> Tags are always contained within a set of angled brackets, and usually will occur in a set-  opening and closing. They look like this: &lttag&gtcontent&lt&#47tag&gt. So for example, to create bold text, you could say: &ltb&gtTitle&lt&#47b&gt
                   </div>
                 </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>     
                 <div class="list_title">Elements</div> 
                   <div class="list_info"> An Element is the information within a set of tags. Elements can have either inline or block behavior.
                   </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <div class="list_title">Attribute</div> 
                   <div class="list_info"> Attributes are information assigned to an element. 
                   </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>       
                <div class="list_title">Anchors</div> 
                   <div class="list_info"> 
                    Anchors are used to create links. An anchor tag looks like this &ltb&gta&lt&#47b&gt
                    To create a link, you could say: &lt a href = "www...." > text that links &gt
                   </div>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <div class="list_title">White Space</div> 
                   <div class="list_info"> 
                    White Space does not naturally exist in coding, so you must force it with break and paragraph tags. 
                   </div>
      </li>
      </ol>
   </div>
    <br>
<!-- End List -->

        <h3>Coding Structure</h3>
         <div class="LessonBody2">
          <p> HTML is considered "tree-like" because elements are nested inside of each other, with nested elements inheriting the traits of the parent element. Nested elements are indented - this is seen in written HTML in the wave shape on the left side of the page. </p>
  </div>
      </div>
    </div>

      <h2 id="lesson3">Lesson 3: Adding Style </h2>

          HTML has underlying structure of boxes, CSS allows us to change the CSS look and feel of the boxes in a systematic way. This is important because it allows us to <b> avoid repetition </b> when coding - meaning changes are easier to make and we'll have fewer errors. 
          <h3>CSS</h3>
          <p> You style HTML using CSS <em> (cascading style sheets)</em>. It gives programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <b> class </b> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class. </p>
